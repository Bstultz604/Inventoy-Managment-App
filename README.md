# Inventoy-Managment-App
Mobile app developed for android that helps users track and manage custom inventory


# Goals and User Needs
The goal of this app was to enable a user to create custom inventory elements. These can then be edited or deleted as the user sees fit. Achieving this goal requires examining the users needs and generating solutions to those needs. The first need was ion the form of authentication and personalization. I designed a login page that would access an internal database designed using SQLite. This ensures each user has access to their own personal inventory. A second user need was intuitive design. When the user enters the app, it should be clear how the app works without needing to explain it to the user. This was achieved by making the inventory screen simple. Elements are added from a floating action button and deleted by long pressing an individual inventory item. 

# Functionality 
Generating functionality for the user can be tricky given countless design conditions. However, simplicity provides a path for functional development. I designed my app with simplicity in mind to help reduce possible functionality problems. The simple designs could later be added to in case more complexity is needed.
